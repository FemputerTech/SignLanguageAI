# About

## Datasets

I used a combination of two datasets from Kaggle, [Hand Sign Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ash2703/handsignimages) and the images for "space" from [Synthetic ASL Alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lexset/synthetic-asl-alphabet)

## Icons

I purchased these icons fron [TheHatchedCottage](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1104909056/asl-alphabet-svg-american-sign-language?click_key=2ae604896a150ace2e9f598b41724f667c08e43d%3A1104909056&click_sum=f62eab80&ga_search_query=asl&ref=shop_items_search_1&crt=1) on Etsy.

## Model

I used a template from [codebasics](https://github.com/codebasics/potato-disease-classification/blob/main/training/potato-disease-classification-model.ipynb) to set up my CNN training model
