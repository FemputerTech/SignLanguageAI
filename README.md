### Datasets
I used a combination of two datasets from Kaggle, [Hand Sign Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ash2703/handsignimages) and the images for "space" from [Synthetic ASL Alphabet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lexset/synthetic-asl-alphabet)

### Model
I used a template from [codebasics](https://github.com/codebasics/potato-disease-classification/blob/main/training/potato-disease-classification-model.ipynb) to set up my CNN training model

### Set up virtual environment
1. Install the virtual environment `python3.11 -m venv .env`
2. Activate the environment in your shell `source .env/bin/activate`
3. Verify the python version `python3 --version`
4. Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Select the python interpreter for the virtual environment and select it in the jupyter notebook (top right side)
